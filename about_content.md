You have stumbled upon the personal site of Jared Roesch.
I'm a first year PhD in the PLSE group at the University of Washington. I am
currently working with [Xi Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~xi/) and
[Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/) on improving the
state of the art in systems programming and verification.

I was previously at the [University of California Santa Barbara]
(https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/) where I was a member of the [PL
Lab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html) and the
[ArchLab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/).

When I'm not busy being a student I worked at the now defunct Zentopy on a
cloud file system, at [Invoca](http://www.invoca.com/) on distributed systems
and general infrastructure, and
[Mozilla Research](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/) on the [Rust]
(https://www.rust-lang.org/) programing language.

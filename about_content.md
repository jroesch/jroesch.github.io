You have stumbled upon the personal website of Jared Roesch.

I'm a second year PhD student in the PLSE group at the University of Washington.
I am advised by [Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/).
I am interested in designing new tools for building and reasoning about critical
software.

I currently am working on a couple different projects. Most recently I have
been constructing verified compilers for adversarial environments,
in particular one for eBPF in the Linux kernel. I am also writing a native
code generator for the [Lean](leanprover.github.io) programming language and theorem prover. When time permits I attempt to contribute to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I was previously at the
[University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/)
where I was a member of the
[PL Lab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html)
and the [ArchLab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/).

In my professional life I worked at the now defunct Zentopy on a
cloud file system, at [Invoca](http://www.invoca.com/) on distributed systems
and infrastructure, and [Mozilla Research](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/)
on the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programing language.

In my personal life I grew up in sunny California and have spent most of my life
there. I enjoy cooking, listening, writing and playing music, reading,
type theory, hacking, coffee, and sleep (when I can).

I am always interested in working with motivated undergraduates who are
interested in verification, compiler hacking, type theory, and more. Feel
free to contact me about doing research.

You have stumbled upon the personal website of Jared Roesch.

I'm a third year PhD student in the PLSE group at the University of Washington.
I am advised by [Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/),
and frequently collaborate with [Leonardo de Moura](http://leodemoura.github.io/).
I am interested in designing new tools for building and reasoning about critical
software.

I am currently working on a couple projects.

One focuses on a design for constructing verified compilers which execute in adversarial
environments, in particular one for eBPF in the Linux kernel. I am also working on various
pieces of the [Lean](leanprover.github.io) programming language and theorem prover, including
native compilation, sledgehammer style tactics, and various development tools including
editor modes.

I have recently have also been working on the [F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/) programming language,
which has been co-designed with [miTLS](http://mitls.org/) as part of the larger
[Everest Expedition](https://project-everest.github.io/). In particular I designed an
experimental Lean backend for F\* verfication conditions, and have been contributing to the
design and implementation of low level programming libraries in F\* and efficient compilation
of F\* to C.

When time permits I attempt to contribute to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I was previously at the
[University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/)
where I was a member of the
[PL Lab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html)
and the [ArchLab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/).

In my professional life I worked at the now defunct Zentopy on a
cloud file system, at [Invoca](http://www.invoca.com/) on distributed systems
and infrastructure, and [Mozilla Research](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/)
on the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programing language.

In my personal life I grew up in sunny California and have spent most of my life
there. I enjoy cooking, listening, writing and playing music, reading,
type theory, hacking, coffee, and sleep (when I can).

I am always interested in working with motivated undergraduates who are
interested in verification, compiler hacking, type theory, and more.
I am always excited to hear from students who are interested in doing
research, feel free to email me.

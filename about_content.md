You have stumbled upon the personal website of Jared Roesch.

I'm a third year PhD student in the PLSE group at the University of Washington.
I am advised by [Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/)
and frequently collaborate with [Leonardo de Moura](http://leodemoura.github.io/).
I am interested in designing new tools for building, optimizing and reasoning about
critical software.

### Projects

I am working on a couple active projects.

#### PL4ML
My main focus designing a new intermediate representation for deep learning frameworks with
[Tianqi Chen](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tqchen/). This IR is intended to be the future
of [NNVM](http://tvmlang.org/).

#### EBPF
One focuses on a design for constructing verified compilers which execute in adversarial
environments, in particular one for eBPF in the Linux kernel.

#### Lean
I am also working on various
pieces of the [Lean](leanprover.github.io) programming language and theorem prover,
including native compilation, sledgehammer style tactics, and various development tools
including editor modes.

#### Everest
I also worked on the [F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/) programming
language, which has been co-designed with [miTLS](http://mitls.org/) as part of the larger
[Everest Expedition](https://project-everest.github.io/).

In particular I designed an experimental Lean backend for F\* verfication conditions, and have
been contributing to the design and implementation of low level programming libraries in
F\* and efficient compilation of F\* to C.

#### Rust
When time permits I attempt to contribute to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Personal

I was previously at the
[University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/)
where I was a member of the
[PL Lab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html)
and the [ArchLab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/).

In my professional life I worked at the now defunct Zentopy on a
cloud file system, at [Invoca](http://www.invoca.com/) on distributed systems
and infrastructure, and [Mozilla Research](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/)
on the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programing language.

In my personal life I grew up in sunny California and have spent most of my life
there. I enjoy cooking, listening, writing and playing music, reading,
type theory, hacking, coffee, and sleep (when I can).

I am interested in working with motivated undergraduates who are interested in compiler hacking, verification,
program analysis, type theory, and more. I am always excited to hear from students who are interested in
doing research, feel free to email me.

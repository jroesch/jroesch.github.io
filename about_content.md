You have stumbled upon the website of Jared Roesch.

I'm a first year PhD in the PLSE group at the University of Washington. I am
advised by [Xi Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~xi/) and
[Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/) on am working
improving the state of the art in systems programming and verification.

I was previously at the
[University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/)
where I was a member of the
[PL Lab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html)
and the [ArchLab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/).

In my professional life I have worked at the now defunct Zentopy on a
cloud file system, at [Invoca](http://www.invoca.com/) on distributed systems
and infrastructure, and [Mozilla Research](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/)
on the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programing language.

In my personal life I grew up in sunny California and lived most of my life
there. I enjoy cooking, listening, writing and playing music, reading,
type theory, hacking, coffee, and sleep (when I can).

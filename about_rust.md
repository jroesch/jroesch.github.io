In my free time I love to work on open source software. My primary contributions
are to the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
I've mostly been responsible for cleaning up the
implementation of the type checker and working on features such
as:

  - where clauses
  - default type parameters
  - type inference
  - trait selection

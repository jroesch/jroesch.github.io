In my free time I love working on open source software. My primary contributions
are to the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
I've was responsible for cleaning up the implementation of the type checker
and working on features such as:

  - where clauses
  - default type parameters
  - type inference
  - trait selection

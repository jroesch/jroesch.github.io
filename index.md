# About Me

You have stumbled upon the personal site of Jared Roesch. I am currently
a first year PhD student at the [University of
Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). I was previously at the
[University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/) where
I was a memeber of the [PL
Lab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~benh/research/research.html) and the
[ArchLab](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/). When I'm not busy being a
student I have worked at the now defunct Zentopy on a cloud file system,
at [Invoca](http://www.invoca.com/) on distributed systems and general infastructure,
and [Mozilla Research](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/) on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

In my free time I love to work on open source software and am a reviewer
and contributor on the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming
language. I've mostly been responsible for cleaning up the
implementation of the typechecker and working on features such
as:

  - where clauses
  - default type parameters
  - type inference
  - trait selection

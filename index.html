        <p> Heyo! I'm Jared Roesch, a sometimes computer scientist, and programmer. I'm currently studying Computer
           Science in the College of Creative Studies at the <a>University of California Santa Barbara</a>. I'm a
           California native, and found computer science at the start of college, and been crazy about it since. I'm 
           usually trying to work on a thousand things at once, but my academic interests are mainly focused around 
           Programming Languages implementation, and Programming Language Theory. Though I have many other interests
           in the field such as Networking, Architecture, OS, and Security(I try to find time to learn about all 
           these also).
        </p> 
           
        <p> In my &quot;professional life&quot; I've spent the last year plus working at Zentopy, a small startup
           in the cloud storage space, we are currently targeting mostly enterprise, by offering a custom storage 
           solution that can either be run on a public cloud such as EC2, or in house. My role there has been all 
           over the place. I've done everything from writing tests and benchmarks, to prototyping our authentication 
           system in Rails, to rewriting more produciton focused version in Python, and many other things like 
           frontend web developemnt, C/C++ server/client work, helping porting our client from Windows 
           to OS X, writing a filesystem layer between our API, and our storage mechanism, and even more. Overall 
           it has been a great experince, and when I came on as an &quot;intern&quot; I didn't expect to be doing so much.         
        </p>
        
        <p> In the last 6 months or so I've become crazy about Haskell(I started learning it about a year ago,
            but I didn't really fall in love until recently). I have subsequently spent most of my free time exploring
            the world of functional programming, and category theory as applied in the FP world. I'm hoping to undertake
            some larger projects in Haskell this year as I'm really starting to feel adept in it.
        </p>
        
        <p> I'm always happy to talk about cool stuff, and work on awesome projects, if you are interested in talking to
            me also, feel free to shoot me an email. 
        </p>
